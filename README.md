### ðŸ›  Deep Learning Problems

In this DL session, we treat topics such as:

- Dense neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks
- Gaussian processes

Here we keep working with the spam e-mails database, and the bike rental company database, and introduce a new penguins characteristics database to solve a classification problem. Link to access this project: [ML_Session](https://quantgang.github.io/MachineLearning_P3/)
